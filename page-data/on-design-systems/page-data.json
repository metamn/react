Others copy or innovate.</p>\n<p>The series walks-through the problem in-depth, from the viewpoint of all stakeholders.</p>\n<p>And proposes a solution — of recent origin — to help companies with less resources to roll their own.</p>\n<h2>1. Workflow, practices and deliverables</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://metamn.io/react/on-design-sytems-1/\">The first article</a> takes a look at existing systems and defines the workflow, practices and deliverables for all stakeholders.</p>\n<h2>2. Design tools and processes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems-2/\">The second article</a> examines design systems from the designer viewpoint.</p>\n<p>Offers novel ideas — design systems as database (code), pair designing — to reduce the cost of rolling out design systems.</p>\n<p>It presents an ideal and working use case where a rare species — a developer who designs — creates a design system, and more, in the browser.</p>\n<h2>3. Consistent user interfaces in web context</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems-3/\">The third article</a> examines design systems from the developer viewpoint.</p>\n<p>It presents past and current front-end development paradigms and examines why they lead, or not, to consistent user interfaces.</p>\n<p>And comes to the conclusion: to end fragility in front-end development — standard software development patterns and practices should replace the current hacking mindset and non-programming languages.</p>\n<h2>4. Implementing a design system in React and Typescript</h2>\n<p>A work in progress. A complete example for developers where the findings above merge into a real-life project.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<p>And for the fun, for a more compact experience, please enjoy the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ukf5kDq7pHGnnExUstssu5Xtl-2yT3KxUp4XU8vvpzE/edit?usp=sharing\">previous iteration</a> on the subject, in a mini-book format.</p>\n<hr>\n<hr>","frontmatter":{"title":"On design systems","date":"November 23, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/on-design-systems/","previous":{"excerpt":"Consistent user interfaces in web context.","fields":{"slug":"/on-design-systems-3/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On design systems — 3"}},"next":{"excerpt":"Scalable and consistent UIs.","fields":{"slug":"/on-design-systems-4/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On design systems — 4"}}}}}
