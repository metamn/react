Now let’s see how the React ecosystem handles this.</p>\n<p>I have <a href=\"/react/after-five-months-react\">React</a>, Gatsby and <a href=\"/react/after-five-months-storybook\">Storybook</a> projects to update and work on them again.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Gatsby</h3>\n<p>Gatsby made two great features in the last period: theming and live previews.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-11-gatsby-themes-roadmap/\">Themes</a> one can assembly Gatsby sites from pre-existing parts.

In sites with many pages (thousands?) this could take minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\n<p>Gatsby is gradually adding what was best in old CMSs still keeping it’s edge — incorporating what’s best on the front-end.</p>\n<p>For more and more people — content creators, static site developers — it will be a fully viable alternative replacing … eh WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-11-gatsby-themes-roadmap/\">Themes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-03-22-introducing-gatsby-preview-beta/\">Live preview</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"After five months — Gatsby","date":"May 10, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/after-five-months-gatsby/","previous":{"excerpt":"We couldn’t have better news.
