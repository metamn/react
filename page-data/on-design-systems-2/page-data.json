Less load, more consistent interfaces.</p>\n<p>To understand the amount of the cognitive load on designers, let’s take for example the buttons. In a simple use case, we have 20 variations.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 768px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/2f950/buttons.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Buttons\"\n        title=\"Buttons\"\n        src=\"/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/5cc77/buttons.png\"\n        srcset=\"/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/72cd8/buttons.png 192w,\n/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/45483/buttons.png 384w,\n/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/5cc77/buttons.png 768w,\n/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/04090/buttons.png 1152w,\n/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/ccc27/buttons.png 1536w,\n/react/static/c909f0839df1620db7e99f2bfdbba943/2f950/buttons.png 1600w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Aside to buttons, a design deals with dozens of other, more complex patterns and components like layout, spacing, typography, navigation, responsiveness, images, animations, accessibility and more.</p>\n<p>A designer — to be able to reason about, modify, or extend a design — has to keep in her mental model an uncomfortable amount of information. The details, the nuances, the settings, the states.</p>\n<p>Design systems solve this challenge via the <em>divide et impera</em> method.</p>\n<p>They separate design into small, independent and manageable parts / layers — style tokens, components, sections, pages, sites, apps — and enforce consistency on the entire path, across the entire portfolio.</p>\n<p>Each layer is independent, self-contained, and acts as a single source of truth for its own domain.</p>\n<p>Each layer builds on the previous layer — without the ability to modify it.</p>\n<p>For example, tokens — the base layer — are atomic, and their single responsibility is to describe style via pure data.</p>\n<p>Components build on tokens, but they don’t interfere with tokens.\nThey use tokens for styling, but they can’t add new, custom styles.\nIf a new style element is required — first it is added to the tokens, then the component becomes able to use it.</p>\n<p>This separation of concerns, augmented with strong human discipline, makes consistency and scalability achievable across hundreds of tokens, components, sites and apps.</p>\n<h2>Tools and processes</h2>\n<p>The systematic approach brought by design systems left untouched the tools and the workflow.</p>\n<p>They are the same today as they were before design systems.</p>\n<p>Designers use visual, non-programmable tools like Figma, Sketch, Adobe Illustrator etc. to create the layers of a design system.</p>\n<p>These tools are visualization tools, not decision-making tools.</p>\n<p>When a designer has to make a decision — to change, extend a design — again, she has to build a mental model first, even if the model is now smaller due to the design system approach.</p>\n<p>The decision made cannot be proven correct in an objective way like we used to have in software development, or in other exact science.</p>\n<p>Designing with mental models is error-prone. Introduces continuous uncertainty. And, for scaling, requires human resources.</p>\n<p>The other drawback of the visual, non-programmable design tools is the deliverables they produce.</p>\n<p>The designer’s work needs to be further translated to the target medium by developers. This process is communication-heavy, error-prone again, and far from being real-time.</p>\n<h2>Better tools and processes</h2>\n<p>It’s easy to observe: the tools used by designers produce side effects related to scalability, communication latency and cost.</p>\n<p>They are the bottleneck in the process of building consistent user interfaces in a scalable way, and, affordable for companies with less resources.</p>\n<p>What if the tools in the design process — in the same way as in the development process — would be programmable?</p>\n<p>What if the outcome of a design process would be a program / data instead of the current visuals-to-be-translated-into-code mess?</p>\n<p>That would solve the mental model capacity problem and reduce the design and development process to real-time.</p>\n<h2>Design systems as a database</h2>\n<p>Imagine the design system as a database.</p>\n<p>Tokens, components, sections, pages, apps, sites — all quantifiable, thus correct. All queryable, to an arbitrarily small level, to fit comfortably into a single person’s mental model.</p>\n<p>Databases handle billions of entries and help us reason about infinite relationships.\nThey help us make correct decisions and ensure changes happen in real-time.</p>\n<p>Designing with the help of databases would offer the same benefits.</p>\n<p>It sounds like utopia — but it can be done today and requires only a minor cultural shift.</p>\n<h2>Pair designing</h2>\n<p>Pair programming is an age-old paradigm.</p>\n<p>Two developers sit in the front of a single machine. They collaborate instantly and produce a single output.</p>\n<p>Pair designing would be similar. A designer and a developer would sit at a single desk and produce a single output.</p>\n<p>The designer would still use her own favourite visual tool like Figma.\nBut the deliverable would not be official — just a temporary result.</p>\n<p>The developer would instantly input the Figma deliverables into a design system built on code, like a database.</p>\n<p>That would be the final, official deliverable — a living design system.</p>\n<h2>A case study</h2>\n<p>I’m fortunate enough to both have a computer science degree and design works featured in online galleries.</p>\n<p>I’m a developer who designs. An ideal pair designer.</p>\n<p>In 2015, I’ve rolled out my portfolio powered by a <a href=\"http://metamn.io/v1/styleguide/\">living styleguide</a>.
