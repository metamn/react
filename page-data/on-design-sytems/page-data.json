Design tools and processes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems-2/\">This article</a> examines design systems from the designer viewpoint.</p>\n<p>Offers novel ideas — design systems as database (code), pair designing — to reduce the cost of rolling out design systems.</p>\n<p>Finally, it presents an ideal and working use case where a rare species — a developer who designs — creates a design system in the browser.</p>\n<h2>3. Consistent user interfaces in web context</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://metamn.io/react/on-design-sytems-3/\">This article</a> examines design systems from the developer viewpoint.</p>\n<p>It presents current front-end development paradigms and examines why they lead, or not, to consistent user interfaces.</p>\n<p>And comes to the conclusion, that hacking and non-programming languages must be replaced with standard software development tools and patterns to end fragility in front-end development.</p>\n<h2>4.
