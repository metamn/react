## You'll need strong motivation

It's been a year since I've started to study design systems, with the ultimate goal to roll my own.

Yes, something like Material UI or Adobe Spectrum taylored for presentational websites, not for web apps.

And yes, one can create presentational websites with existing design systems and component libraries. But the final result &mdash; no matter the customization and theming &mdash; will not be unique-looking.

It will look like just another website: it will use the same basic components &mdash; hero, card, accordion, drawer, badge, chip &mdash; you name it &mdash; with slightly different styling.

It's nothing wrong with that. Not all websites must stand out.

I'm a designer and developer with works featured in online galleries.
One of them is Brutalist Websites &mdash; a showcase of websites created by hand, using custom made components, experimental techniques, challenging the status quo.

This is the line I pursue in my career, this is why I need a design system / component library built from scratch, producing unique looking websites.

## You'll spend lots of time

In the last year I've analyzed a dozen of existing design systems.

I wrote articles, a mini-book / technical guide on how to roll your own.

I've learnt other languages and stacks to better understand the current theory and best practices.

I've done four iterations on my own design system.

And I've employed it in a couple of real-life applications.

Yet, after a year, I'm at the beginning. One iteration left, and I'll be able to roll out &mdash; design and develop &mdash; scalable, consistent, unique looking user interfaces in no time.

## You'll be rewarded

In short, the design system / component library I've created is capable of:

1. Wireframing &mdash; to sketch up the requirement specifications and get immediate feedback on them.
2. Mockuping &mdash; to show real-life components with test data, helping to finalize the information architecture.
3. Inline content editing &mdash; to let editors add their content as soon as possible, to find out missing parts and inconsistencies in the original requirement specifications.
4. Theming &mdash; to support design trials and errors, iterations and variations. In a fully responsive way.
5. Generating documentation and playground &mdash; to assure components work in isolation, are tested, and all design system tokens and components are documented.
