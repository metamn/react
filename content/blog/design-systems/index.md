## You'll need strong motivation

It's been a year since I've started to study design systems, with the ultimate goal to roll my own.

Yes, something like Material UI or Adobe Spectrum taylored for presentational websites, not for web apps.

And yes, one can create presentational websites with existing design systems and component libraries. But the final result &mdash; no matter the customization and theming &mdash; will not be unique-looking.

It will look like just another website: it will use the same basic components &mdash; hero, card, accordion, drawer, badge, chip &mdash; you name it &mdash; with slightly different styling.

It's nothing wrong with that. Not all websites must stand out.

I'm a designer and developer with works featured in online galleries.
One of them is Brutalist Websites &mdash; a showcase of websites created by hand, using custom made components, experimental techniques, challenging the status quo.

This is the line I pursue in my career, this is why I need a design system / component library built from scratch, producing unique looking websites.
