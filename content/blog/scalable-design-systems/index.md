## Introduction

Scalability in software systems is a complex topic.

It deals with the product, the production process, and with the technology used in the product and production.

The product should be fast, correct and usable. The process should be stable, extensible, and maintainable &mdash; requiring as little cognitive load as possible.

The parts of the tech stack should be carefully picked during trials and experimentations. Then merged into a system which works. Often by herculean efforts.

Complexity rises along the process.

Products might have complex features and building blocks &mdash; some of them acting as standalone products and requiring a separate analysis.

Scalability criterias will expand. Aspects of scalability will overlap.

That all leads to a large knowledge graph, a multi-dimensional matrix when visualizing and understanding scalability complexity.

Narrowing down scalability to web user interfaces reduces the complexity of the problem.
Hopefully to a level one can comprehend, can study, and present the findings in a compact way.

## Scalability in _consistent_ web user interfaces

Web design and development started thirty years ago. Since then it went through three major iterations.

The last iteration &mdash; the component model &mdash; is young, widespread and production ready. Among other advantages, [it helps create uniform, consistent web interfaces](), aka. design systems.

This study will focus on scalable design systems.

General web user interfacee scalability, covering component libraries and template-based UI frameworks is out of scope. They would drive this study complex and incomprehensible.

Even alone, scalable design systems act as a complex topic. They require a progressive approach. Mapping the problem domain, picking the critical parts to solve first, then iterating.
