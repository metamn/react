Consistent user interfaces in web context. A theory.

## Consistent user interfaces

Consistent &mdash; coherent and uniform &mdash; user interfaces eliminate all visual and logical glitches.

User interfaces, when consistent, _feel_ complete. They have no visible errors, and the experience they provide resembles enjoying an artwork.

Consistent, [by definition](https://www.wordnik.com/words/consistent), is in agreement with itself. It holds true as a group, it's not contradictory. It's marked by an orderly, logical, and aesthetically consistent relation of parts. It's unity and harmony.

Consistent UIs talk about the intent and the mastery of its creators. They persuade. They deliver an important message.

## The current landscape

Until recent years, creating consistent user interfaces were an almost impossible task.

With design systems &mdash; introducing a novel design process &mdash; it became possible.

Design systems ain't a silver bullet. Success isn't guaranteed out of the box. It still requires team discipline and solid mental work. Or, [better tooling](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems-2/).

But at least, creating consistent user interfaces is now possible with design systems. Across platforms.

## The contexts

Current tools and processes in UX/UI design and development, even with design systems, produce two separate, independent deliverables.

First, a visual design, not related at all to code. Then the code, the translation of the design to a platform, via code.

This article examines the web context. How to create consistent UIs with web technologies.

## The web context

The core web platform &mdash; we all know very well &mdash; is the browser.

Using technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, WebGL, and more, it manages to display interactive information across devices.

Consistent UIs in web context, thus, translates into implementing a design system with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and run it in the browser.

## The buzzwords

Let's start by mapping up the web buzzwords related to design systems.

![The context](ds-context-black-nologo.png)

The quadrants put design systems into a historical context &mdash; each quadrant representing an era in web development. The historical timeline is depicted counter-clockwise.

The axes put web development into a larger &mdash; software development &mdash; context: APIs and frameworks.

And the buzzwords, in short:

In the beginning &mdash; **Classless HTML** &mdash; there weren't much styling on websites. Hence HTML was not linked to CSS via class names. However this paradigm lately became a [trend](https://css-tricks.com/no-class-css-frameworks/) again due to it's simplicity and scalability.

**CSS Frameworks** are ubiquoitus. Bootstrap, Foundation, Tachyons, Bulma, Tailwind. Perhaps they style 90% or more of all webpages today.

**Component libraries** and **design systems** are new. The line between them is blurry for the novice. But &mdash; it turns out in the next chapters &mdash; this line defines if a UI is consistent or not.

## Consistent user interfaces in web context

It takes a journey from user interfaces to consistent web UIs &mdash; a dozen of steps, some steps depicting an era in front-end development.

For those on the rush there is a big picture. It's enjoyable on larger screens via a click.

For the rest, there is a breakdown. A step-by-step overview of the process where a consistent UI theory unfolds.

## User interfaces

![UI](ui1.png)

User interfaces display information equipped with structure, presentation and behaviour.

Structure and presentation is familiar from graphic and print design. It defines layout and style.

Behaviour is specific to interactive environments. This dynamic context requires the user interface to handle change &mdash; to behave on change.

Per se, it equips information with a dynamic attribute.

## Web user interfaces

Web user interfaces rely on a specific technology &mdash; the browser &mdash; to display information.

Browsers:

- Structure information with HTML.
- Define style via CSS.
- Handle behaviour using JavaScript.

## Binding

![Binding](ui3.png)

HTML, CSS and JavaScript are standalone technologies. To work together &mdash; they need to bind together.

The way of binding, the binding methods, are important. Each method defines an era in web design and development.

### Classless

This paradigm makes no bounds between HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It leaves binding exclusively to the browser.

HTML has no classes, styles attached. Styling comes from a separate CSS file, where all HTML elements are styled by name.

### Class-based binding

A next iteration, which connects the separate parts &mdash; CSS, Javascript &mdash; via HTML attributes, class names.

### Props

The latest advancement, which integrates &mdash; binds natively &mdash; all parts into a single standalone component. And composes up components via props.

## API

![API](ui4.png)

The acronym stands for Application Programming Interface.

APIs bind together the standalone parts of a system &mdash; in our case HTML, CSS and Javascript &mdash; in a programmable way.

The higher the programmability, the better the system.

At the beginning, in the classless era programming the web was difficult. It was no API.

After iterations, and now in the components and props era, the web became fully programmable like any other software environment.

## Template and Component-based UI frameworks

Template-based UI frameworks use class names as API mechanism to bind HTML, CSS and Javascript together.

The binding is open. Parts combine freely without constraints.

An HTML element can take any number of CSS styles or JavaScript interaction handlers.

This leads to an open API. Where everything is possible, even chaotic user interfaces.

Component-based UI frameworks natively bind HTML, CSS and Javascript into standalone components.

They compose up components into larger systems via props &mdash; another, more advanced API mechanism.

Arbitrary composition leads to an open API. Constraints-based composition leads to a closed API.

Component frameworks, unlike Template-based frameworks, are free to choose which way to go.

## Open and closed APIs

![Open API](ui7.png)
![Closed API](ui8.png)

In an open API parts compose up freely. There are no constraints and there is unlimited room for experimentation and play.

CSS frameworks and Component libraries embrace this technique.

CSS frameworks have no choice, they are open by nature. Component libraries made this choice explicit.

Closed APIs restrict the composition of the building blocks to specific rules.

Systems can't build up freely but following a purpose and direction.

Design systems embrace the closed API principle.
