## The web context

[The DS series on this blog](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems/) study consistent and scalable user interfaces with the help of design systems.

Across disciplines &mdash; design and development &mdash; and platforms &mdash; web and native.

Let's focus, for now, to the web platform, and examine consistency using the web's technical terms.

The first chart maps the buzzwords.

The second chart connects the buzzwords to well-know web technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Please click on each image and enjoy it in separation.
