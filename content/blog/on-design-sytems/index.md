Design systems bring a complex and novel approach to UI/UX design and development &mdash; to solve its inherent UI consistency and scalability problems.

So far, only dedicated companies with resources could afford a design system.

The series walks-through the problem in-depth, and from the viewpoint of all stakeholders.

And proposes simple solutions, of recent origin, for companies with less resources &mdash; to roll their own.

## 1. Worklfow and deliverables

An introductory article for all stakeholders focusing on common [workflow, practices and deliverables](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-sytems-1/).

## 2. Design tools and processes

[This article](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems-2/) examines design systems from the designer viewpoint.

Offers novel ideas &mdash; design systems as database (code), pair designing &mdash; to reduce the cost of rolling out design systems.

Finally, it presents an ideal and working use case where a rare specie &mdash; a developer who designs &mdash; creates a design system in the browser.

## 3. Consistent user interfaces in web context

[This article](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-sytems-3/) examines design systems from the developer viewpoint.

It presents current front-end development paradigms and examines why they lead, or not, to consistent user interfaces.

And comes to the conclusion, that hacking and non-programming languages must be replaced with standard software development tools and patterns to end fragility in front-end development.

## 4. Implementing a design system in React and Typescript

A work in progress. A complete example for developers to apply the findings from the previous articles.
