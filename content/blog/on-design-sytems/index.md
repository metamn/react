Design systems bring a complex and novel approach to UI/UX design and development &mdash; to solve its inherent consistency and scalability problems.

However, as of today, only dedicated companies with resources can afford their own custom design system. This must change.

The series walks-through the problem in-depth, from the viewpoint of all stakeholders, and proposes simple solutions, of recent origin, for companies with less resources &mdash; to be able to roll their own.

## 1. Workflow, practices and deliverables

[The first is an](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-sytems-1/) introductory article &mdash; based on extensive analysis &mdash; for all stakeholders, focusing on common workflow, practices and deliverables.

## 2. Design tools and processes

[The second article](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems-2/) examines design systems from the designer viewpoint.

Offers novel ideas &mdash; design systems as database (code), pair designing &mdash; to reduce the cost of rolling out design systems.

Finally, it presents an ideal and working use case where a rare species &mdash; a developer who designs &mdash; creates a design system, and more, in the browser.

## 3. Consistent user interfaces in web context

[The third article](http://metamn.io/react/on-design-systems-3/) examines design systems from the developer viewpoint.

It presents past and current front-end development paradigms and examines why they lead, or not, to consistent user interfaces.

And comes to the conclusion, that hacking and non-programming languages must be replaced with standard software development tools and patterns to end fragility in front-end development.

## 4. Implementing a design system in React and Typescript

A work in progress. A complete example for developers where the findings above merge into a real-life project.
